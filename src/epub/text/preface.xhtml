			<p>This is the story of the first adventure of Arsène Lupin, and undoubtedly it would have been published before the stories of the others if he had not so often and so resolutely opposed it.</p>
			<p>“No,” he would say, “there are one or two little matters yet to be settled between the Countess of Cagliostro and me. We must wait.”</p>
			<p>The waiting lasted longer than he foresaw. More than a quarter of a century passed before the final settlement; and only to-day am I permitted to relate the frightful duel of love and hate which brought a boy of twenty to grips with Cagliostro’s daughter.</p>
